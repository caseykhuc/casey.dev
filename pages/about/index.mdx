## Hello, it's Casey Phong Khuc!
### I worked as a Software engineer at **Got It Vietnam** for 4 years until March, 2024 and now I'm doing freelance and personal projects.

This is my space to share:
- my knowledge and experience as a developer
- progress of my personal projects
- [my daily learning](/learning-log), about tech, life, and everything else

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me at the below contact information.
