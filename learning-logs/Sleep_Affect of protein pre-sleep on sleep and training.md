- What things are affected?
	- Resting metabolic rate 
		- slightly improved with CP, remains the same with WP
		- Positive results only with **48g CP**, remains the same with 24g
	- RE
		- no proved improvement
	- overnight muscle protein synthesis
		- 40g protein digested throughtout the night brings improvement
	- muscle size/strength, muscle recovery
		- unknown, show impact in some but not all researches - [muscle recovery](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/7/2049)
	- sleep quality
		- metrics: sleep durations / sleep disturbances
		- 7.6 ± 7.3 g doesn't have an impact
		- for larger amount, results are still vague, more researches are needed
