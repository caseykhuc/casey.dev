#### Takeaways
## HOW
- light is vital in [[Circadian rhythm]]
	- mechanism
		- a special group of cells in the retina (võng mạc) senses light -> signal the brain to interpret
		- brain ([[cardian pacemaker]]) sends signal to the body and organs
	- reflex to our modern lifestyle
		- light is heavily abundant (excess)
		- poorly timed
		- consequences
			- worsened metabolism (since the brain mis-signals the organs)
			- weight gain
			- cardiovascular problems
			- elevated cancer risks
			- mood / mental health, [[seasonal affective disorder]]
	- ==however, sometime the day light is just not right==
- affect melatonin production
	- mechanism
		- [[pineal gland]] (tuyến tùng) in the brain starts producing in the dark
		- light exposure pause or reduce production
	- melatonin creates downsiness (sleepiness)
	- melatonin also affects [[Circadian rhythm]] -> reinforcing
- sleep circle (quality of sleep)
	- excess light cause repeated awakening, reduce deep sleep #to-read 
- [[Circadian rhythm]] disorder
	- example: jet lag / shift work / distored daily behavior
	- -> clinical approach: light therapy #to-read [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17395535/)
## WHAT
- All of them
- illuminance (brightness) is coresponded for impact intensity
- sunlight
	- ~ 10.000 lux
- bright office light
	- ~ 500 lux
- blue light
	- emitted by many LEDs, electronic devices
	- short wavelength -> large effect on both melatonin and circadian rhythm, especially evening use
