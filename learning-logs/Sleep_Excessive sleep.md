#### Self-explanation / Summary
Spending extra time on bed on weekends are fine, but excessive sleep regularly might be a symptoms for physical and mental negative condition.

Depression is a popular cause. Other contributors are quality of sleep, or the way one wakes up.

Regular sleep routine and exercise might helps, which is a positive circle; since elimination of excessive sleep in-turn helps preserve time and energy for personal goals, physical and mental well-being.
#### Personal thoughts
- Today I woke up at 10, and ended up mindless scrolling until noon. Came downstair to have lunch then back to bed to scrolling and sleeping again until 3, 4. Some hypothesis about the cause of this is:
	- [[Overstimulation]] The day before I went out with Dan and it's really energy-sucking. I felt totally drained after the meet since it's really lack of listening and one-sided.
	- Depression. Lack of motivation, etc. However, I don't really feel that lack of energy or darkness. Just kind of doom and hesitation.
	- Bad quality of sleep
	- It's just myself lacking self-control
	- Escapism ([[Why we so attached with OTP?]] ?) I quitted my job a month ago and now still haven't touched anything related to my profession, maybe deep down I panicked.
- Some thing might be related
	- Lack of motivation to take shower / get dressed, clean the room, etc.
		- Yes, I love taking shower and get dressed but not cleaning the room. I still love the outcome though.
		- Mindset: Just do tiny improvement: 1min for 1 area and just move on. 5-10 mins a day then it'll be surprising.
- Personal consequences
	- Really bad mood
	- Lose the momemtum to current habits
	- Time wasted
